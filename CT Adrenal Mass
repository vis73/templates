Clinical History: []
*
Indication: []
*
Comparison: [Relevant imaging date]
*
Technique: Unenhanced axial CT of the adrenal glands, followed by IV and GI contrast axial CT imaging through the adrenal glands.  Imaging was continued through the abdomen [and pelvis].  After [15*|10] minutes delay, delayed axial images were again obtained through the adrenal glands.
IV contrast: [# ml] [<Contrast agent and concentration>] 
Oral contrast: [<Contrast agent and concentration>]
*
Findings:
*
Right adrenal gland:  [The right adrenal gland is normal.*] OR 

[There is an adrenal mass measuring [# x # mm]. The mass is [homogeneous|heterogeneous] in attenuation on unenhanced images.  The unenhanced attenuation of the mass is [# HU].  The adrenal mass measures [# HU] on parenchymal phase images. The adrenal mass measures [# HU] on delayed phase images.  Absolute washout is [#%]. 
*
Left adrenal gland: [The left adrenal gland is normal.*] OR

[There is an adrenal mass measuring [# x # mm]. The mass is [homogeneous|heterogeneous] in attenuation on unenhanced images.   The unenhanced attenuation of the mass is [# HU].  The adrenal mass measures [# HU] on parenchymal phase images. The adrenal mass measures [# HU] on delayed phase images.  Absolute washout is [#%]. 
*
Remainder of study:

Liver: [No abnormal enhancement seen in the liver.  There is no ductal dilation.]
*
Gallbladder: [Normal.][Absent.]
*
Spleen: [Normal.]
*
Pancreas: [Normal.]
*
Kidneys: [Kidneys enhance symmetrically without hydronephrosis.]
*
Lymph nodes: [There is no mesenteric, retroperitoneal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.]
*
Mesentery/Peritoneum: [Normal*]
*
Stomach/Small bowel/Large Bowel: [No obstruction or dilation of bowel.]
*
Free fluid: [There is no evidence of free fluid.]
*
Blood vessels: [Vessels enhance normally.]
*
Skeletal structures and soft tissues: [Normal.]
*
GU: [Normal.]
*
Lung bases:  [Normal. No pulmonary nodules or pleural effusion.]
*
IMPRESSION:
*
[Normal study of the adrenal glands.]
[Right|Left|Bilateral] adrenal mass in keeping with [lipid-rich adenoma| lipid-poor adenoma| myelolipoma.]
